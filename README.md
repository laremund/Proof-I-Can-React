## **Proof-I-Can-React**

### _React project serving as a demo for employers to look at_

- Within this simple React app, I show my skills with the React framework by creating a well-designed "Portfolio". Goal is to have something fun for me to work on that also showcases my abilities
- Uses Material UI (MUI), because I believe in reusing code as much as possible. I made an effort todo lots of my own custom features, though, and the MUI components often have to be customized themselves

### **Sections**

- **Resume**
  - Basic page or two with resume-like things, has a section where people that have access to the link can comment on the resume
- **Blog**
  - A section that allows me to write stuff and post it, also allows for anyone with the link to comment on posts
